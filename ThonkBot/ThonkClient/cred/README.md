# configs

A `config.json` file should be here.

Contains token and configurations of the bot.\n
It should be added into gitignore as you should never publicly expose the Bot Token.

### config.json

The current template for `config.json`

```
{
  "Token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```

Set `copy to output directory` to `Copy Always`.
